## The most important things I learned so far <a name="imp"></a>

- knowing technologies is overrated. With solid foundations you can learn and master any technology
- start with the problem, not the technology that you want to use
- thinking about a problem and solution (doing architecture and design work) before actually coding goes a long way towards maintainability
- bad communication is the root of a huge number of problems
- people underestimate (a lot!) the power of good documentation
- automated testing is a must have for non-trivial projects
- good UX (at least) is essential

## What do I mean by "solid foundations"? <a name="solid"></a>

Essentially, having above average (at least) knowledge of the following topics:

- algorithms and data structures
- software design and architecture
- programming logic
- testing
- documentation
- code review
- communication
- UX

## Cool but... what have you worked with? <a name="tech"></a>

Ok.. the technologies that I used the most are:

- JavaScript (React, Node.js)
- Python
- C++ ([please no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
- Protocol Buffers
- HTML/CSS
- TypeScript
- Vim
- VSCode
- Bazel (build system)
- Bash ([noooooooo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
- Java (also no)
- REST (for APIs and databases - think crud)
- SQL/NoSQL

But I used a LOT of others. I'll separate them into three groups.

There are more, but I won't remember all of them now.

Currently, take a look at the highlighted ones, but I might choose to share more than those, so keep an eye out.
