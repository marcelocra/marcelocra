### Hey, there, Marcelo here ðŸ‘‹

This is my "coding home" and you're very much welcome!

I'm working on a bunch of interesting stuff that will slowly
appear here, so follow if you'd like to know more.

Main topics are:

- Dev workflow, setup and tools
- Programming languages and interesting projects
  - Deno, Deno Fresh and Deno Deploy (all with TypeScript)
  - F# (for web and apps, with Elmish and Bolero)
  - Clojure
  - maybe Rust and Go

Want to get in touch? Just send a message on [Telegram](https://bit.ly/3NwNHXK).

See you soon. ;)
