## Elevator pitch

Hello! 👋

My name is Marcelo.

I'm proud to say that <strong><u style="text-underline-offset: 4px; text-decoration-thickness: 2px">I quit Google to follow my entrepreneurship dreams</u></strong>!

I'm a Software Developer and I believe that designing solutions even a little bit before actually coding them allows us to **produce better results, faster**.

I also believe that **maintainability** is one of the **most important features of a codebase**, with readability good architecture and code readability playing a fundamental part in that.

Now I'll list some coding stuff that I like and find interesting or useful, including projects that I created and maintain.

If you want to know more about me or get in touch, keep reading [below](#more). I also added some typical GitHub readme stats there 😆️.

## Useful, interesting, cool, coding stuff

#### Technologies

- [Astro](https://astro.build): I created my website using [Astro](https://astro.build) (it is in the **site** repo, pinned below). It is a full-stack framework and defaults to generating static sites that are VERY fast.

  Good performance means better user experinece, and it should always be one of our focuses.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): great, productive, alternative to writing pure CSS.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/): Tailwind plugin with many beautiful styles for frequently used components (button, tooltip, etc).
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx): great helper for writing conditional CSS/Tailwind classes.
- [Deno](https://deno.land): JavaScript and TypeScript runtime with very interesting features.

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org): amazing language for people that are not allergic to parethesis haha.
- [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka): use Clojure to write scripts without the JVM startup penalty.
- [nbb](https://github.com/babashka/nbb): write ClojureScript that is executed directly in code, without a compilation step.

#### Code references

- [Google Closure Keyboard Shortcut Handler example](https://gist.github.com/marcelocra/930fc699e3b6367df1aad81811668e3c): works in JavaScript too, even though the example is in ClojureScript.
- [ClojureScript nbb example script](https://gist.github.com/marcelocra/0f41381c0c1e251efe700a1c3bb0e3fa).

#### Tech interview references

I haven't used all references mentioned here. This is a sort of "bookmark" with stuff that seems good and that I intend to use.

- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com.br/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850): great book that helped me pass Google interviews.

- [Tech interview cheat sheet](https://github.com/tsiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet)

  > _This list is meant to be both a quick guide and reference for further research into these topics. It's basically a summary of that comp sci course you never took or forgot about, so there's no way it can cover everything in depth._

- [Tech interview handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook)
  > _Curated coding interview preparation materials for busy software engineers._

## About me <a name="more"></a>

- I completed my Computer Engineering undergrad at **ITA** (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica), one of Brazil's most renowned engineering schools, from 2010 to 2015. 🇧🇷
- During that time, I studied one year abroad, in The Netherlands 🇳🇱, attending both TU/e (Eindhoven University of Technology) and UT (University of Twente).
- I worked at **Google** as an intern for 6 months in 2015 and as a full time developer from 2016 to 2020.
- I worked at startups after 2020, until **deciding to create my own company**.
- I have **15<!-- (curr_year - 2010 + 1) -->+ years** of coding experience. Wrote my **first line of code** in C, in 2010.

Check some of my projects [below](#projects).

Also, I share a little bit of what I learned and am learning <a href="https://github.com/marcelocra/marcelocra/blob/master/details.md#table-of-contents-" target="_blank">here</a> (in English) and [in my blog](https://marcelocra.dev/blog) (in Brazilian Portuguese).

You can check my social pages (linked in the profile) if you want to get in touch.

Cheers!\
Marcelo.

## My projects <a name="projects"></a>

Currently (18jul2024), my pinned repos show some of my relevant public projects. Not everything fit there, as GitHub only allows 6 pinned repos, so I list more stuff at my website and CV (want to bring some here eventually).

<details>
<summary>FYI: I'm ignoring some languages. Click here to see why.</summary>
<br />

1. They are not languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, Dockerfile).
1. I haven't used them meaningfully in a long time (e.g. Python, Java, C, C++).
1. I use them mostly as "glue" and not to write actual programs (e.g. Shell, PowerShell, Vimscript).
