## Hey there, welcome! 👋🏽

My name is Marcelo. I'm a computer engineer from ITA, a former Google engineer, full-stack developer with 15+ years of experience, and an entrepreneur.

I spent 4.5 years at Google[^google] before quitting to explore something new: building developer tools, micro-SaaS, and AI-native applications.

These days I work with an **"Engineer in the Loop"** approach: I use LLMs and agents as teammates to ship high-quality code faster, while keeping architectural oversight and maintaining the code quality standards I learned at Google.

[^google]: Working mostly with C++, Python and JavaScript.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

**Developer Tools:**

- **[vscode-improved](https://github.com/marcelocra/vscode-improved)**: A VS Code extension bundling quality-of-life improvements. Built it to learn the Extensions API while improving my own workflow.
- **[ghostkeys](https://github.com/marcelocra/ghostkeys)**: A keyboard remapper in Rust. I architect and review, agents help with the low-level Rust code.
- **[brave-byom-compat](https://github.com/marcelocra/brave-byom-compat)**: Compatibility layer between AI models and Brave's Leo AI.

**AI-Powered Stuff:**

- **[concept-compass](https://github.com/marcelocra/concept-compass)** (Hackathon): An infinite mind-map generator using OpenAI's OSS models. Built it to test and learn [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) (an AI-powered, spec-driven coding assistant).
- **[Viralei](https://viralei.com.br)** (Hackathon): Turns legislative bills into engaging videos using AI. Built and deployed the MVP in 4 days, with Next.js. Still working on it.

**Products & Companies:**

- **Futurin** (Founder): My software lab where I build and deploy micro-SaaS products using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
- **Adapta AI Challenge**: Selected as one of ~80 finalists (from 2,000+ applicants) for Brazil's largest AI Hackathon. Built an OOH analytics tool in ~24h, placed Top 3, and qualified to present at the main stage event for ~7,000 attendees.

### 🛠 Tech I Work With

I wrote my first line of code in 2010, in C. Then I learned Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. These days I work mostly with **TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS**, along with plenty of other tech when they are called for.

At Google I worked with **C++, Python, Java, and Bazel** (build systems). I also have experience with **VS Code Extensions API, Chrome Extensions API, Docker/Podman, and GitHub Actions**.

For AI work, I mostly use **GitHub Copilot** (in VS Code and github.com) with **Roo Code** and **Codex extensions**, **Jules** (jules.google.com), and **Kiro**. I've also used **Claude Code, Gemini CLI**, and **Zed** (zed.dev). I use **Anthropic API** and **OpenRouter** as model providers for VS Code Copilot and apps. Lots of prompt engineering.

### 💡 What I Learned & Believe

**From Google:**

- The value of **code reviews, testing, documentation**, and treating **maintainability as a feature**
- How to work with strict 6-week release cycles on a massive C++ codebase (Chromium)
- How to build globally scalable data pipelines (Java/Flume)
- That **good practices are fundamental** when creating great software

**What I believe now:**

- **Solid foundations matter**: Algorithms, system design, and architecture knowledge are essential to use AI tools effectively. **How will I know the AI gave me a good solution if I don't understand the bounds?**
- **AI as a teammate**: LLMs serve as powerful productivity multipliers, yet human judgment on design and architecture remains essential.
- **Ship fast, maintain well**: High velocity with strong architectural oversight—not one or the other
