My name is Marcelo. I'm a Computer Engineer from **ITA**[^ita] and a former **Google** engineer (Search, Data Pipelines / Dataflow, Chromium) with 15+ years of experience. I quit Big Tech to explore entrepreneurship and am now building **AI-native applications** and **tools**.

I use AI agents (Cursor, OpenCode, Roo Code, etc.) as force multipliers to ship high-quality code rapidly, while retaining control over system design and architecture.

[^ita]: Widely regarded as one of Brazil's top, if not the best, engineering institutes (Top 1%), known for its extremely rigorous entry and high academic standards.

## AI Apps & Tools

I am actively building with **AI Agents** and studying their impact on **Developer Experience (DX)**.

### 🦀 [ghostkeys](https://github.com/marcelocra/ghostkeys) (Rust + AI)
A high-performance keyboard remapper written in **Rust**.
* **Why it matters:** I built this functional Rust desktop tray application in just a couple of days with **zero prior Rust experience**. The goal was to test if my product and system design ideas would port well to a strictly typed language using a spec-driven AI workflow. Built using Kiro (kiro.dev).

### 🧠 [concept-compass](https://github.com/marcelocra/concept-compass) (LLM Eval)
An infinite mind-map generator powered by OpenAI's OSS models.
* **Why it matters:** This started as my first attempt at hosting **LLMs** locally. It proved unfeasible, as my hardware couldn't handle even the 20b model efficiently. This constraint pushed me to discover OpenRouter. Today, I use OpenRouter daily to power not just apps like this, but many parts of my toolchain (Zed, OpenCode, Roo Code, Continue).

### 🤖 Solo Founder AI Engine
My conceptual framework for AI-assisted development, designed to optimize the "Engineer in the Loop" workflow.
* **Why it matters:** It allowed me to develop a **3-Phase Workflow** that matches model capability to task complexity, leveraging **Frontier Models**, **Top Models** and **Cheap/Weak Models**.

### ⚡ [vscode-improved](https://github.com/marcelocra/vscode-improved)
A VS Code extension bundling quality-of-life improvements.
* **Why it matters:** My first hands-on experience using the VS Code Extension API to optimize my own workflow.

## Other Projects

* **[devmagic](https://github.com/marcelocra/devmagic):** A devcontainer setup that "just works," solving the "works on my machine" problem.
* **Adapta AI Challenge:** **Top 3 Finalist** in Brazil's largest-ever hackathon. Built an OOH analytics tool in ~24h.
* **[Viralei](https://viralei.com.br):** **Hackathon Project.** Turns legislative bills into engaging videos. Built the MVP in 4 days.
* **Fair Pricing Works:** Open Source initiative advocating for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).

## Tech Stack

I wrote my first line of code in 2010 (in C). Today, I choose tools that mix personal preference, velocity, and leverage.

* **Core:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS.
* **Systems & AI:** Rust, Python (Automation/Pipelines), C++ (Google background).
* **AI Workflow:** Zed, Cursor, OpenCode/Aider, VS Code (with Roo Code & Continue.dev), Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and Google Jules.
* **Tooling:** OpenRouter, Anthropic API, Google AI Studio, Firebase Studio, Chrome Extensions API, Docker/Podman, DevContainers.

## What I Believe

* **Solid foundations matter:** Algorithms and system design are essential to use AI effectively. *How will I know the AI gave me a good solution if I don't understand the bounds?*
* **AI as a teammate:** LLMs are multipliers, but human judgment on architecture is non-negotiable.
* **Ship fast, maintain well:** High velocity should not come at the cost of messy code.
