### Hey, welcome! Marcelo here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm slowly updating this, so please don't mind if repos seem a bit
outdated. There's a lot of new (and exciting!) stuff in the works and this readme
(along with pinned stuff) will be updated (hopefully) soon.

Wanna talk to me? Just send a message on [Telegram](https://bit.ly/3NwNHXK).

See you soon. ;)
