## Hey there, welcome! 👋🏽

My name is Marcelo. I'm a computer engineer from ITA, a former Google engineer, full-stack developer with 15+ years of experience, and an entrepreneur.

I spent 4.5 years at Google[^google] before quitting to explore something new: building developer tools, micro-SaaS, and AI-native applications.

These days I work with an **"Engineer in the Loop"**[^eitl] approach: I use LLMs and AI agents like **GitHub Copilot**, **Roo Code**, **Continue.dev** and others as teammates to ship high-quality code faster, while keeping architectural oversight and maintaining the code quality standards I learned at Google.

[^google]: Working mostly with C++, Python and JavaScript.
[^eitl]: I discovered this term in a job posting from Roo Code. It matches how I already think about AI-assisted development, so I decided to use.

### 🚀 What I'm Building - Highlights

- **Futurin** (Founder): My software lab where I build and deploy micro-SaaS products using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui (mostly).
- **Adapta AI Challenge**: Selected as **one of ~80 finalists** (from 2,000+ applicants) for **Brazil's largest AI Hackathon**. Built an OOH analytics tool in ~24h, placed **Top 3**, and presented to **~7,000 people** at the Adapta Summit main stage.
- **Fair Pricing Works** (Community Contribution, Open Source): A website focused on bringing attention to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). In the AI and subscription era, it is harder than it needed to be for people living in countries with depreciated currencies, like Brazil or India. PPP helps bridge the gap.
- **Quick prototypes**: Most ideas I want to try start out as **quick prototypes** just for myself, built using **GitHub Spark** (or similar tools: v0.app, bolt.new, etc.) and **prompt engineering**.

**✨ AI-Powered Stuff:**

- **Chronos Task Manager** (Product): An event-driven task management system with AI-powered natural language parsing. See [details about architecture, features and tech stack](https://gist.github.com/marcelocra/b1601766323d5b901d23660b211e0730).
- **[Acerto AI](https://acerto.ai)** (Product): A personal assistant for debt collection via WhatsApp. Building with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Evolution API, etc.
- **[concept-compass](https://github.com/marcelocra/concept-compass)** (Hackathon): An infinite mind-map generator using OpenAI's OSS models. Built it to test and learn [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) (an AI-powered, spec-driven coding assistant).
- **Solo Founder AI Engine** (In Progress): An integrated system orchestrating multiple AI tools: VS Code with Roo Code, Copilot, and Codex, plus n8n and Dify for workflow automation. Being designed to help solo founders ship like a team.

**🧑🏽‍💻 Developer Tools:**

- **[devmagic](https://github.com/marcelocra/devmagic)**: A devcontainer setup that "just works", built in public to help developers avoid configuring the same things over and over again.
- **[ghostkeys](https://github.com/marcelocra/ghostkeys)**: A keyboard remapper in Rust. Started with Kiro as a spec-driven project; now migrating to Roo Code to validate the GitHub Spec-Kit workflow.
- **[vscode-improved](https://github.com/marcelocra/vscode-improved)**: A VS Code extension bundling quality-of-life improvements. Built to improve my own workflow while learning the Extensions API.

**🆕 Up Next:**

- **Do I Need a License** (Community Contribution, Open Source): The fastest way to choose the right license for your project. A modern, opinionated license chooser for developers. Get your answer in 30 seconds without reading legal documents.
- **Touchpad Navigation Pro** (Community Contribution, Open Source): Navigate back/forward with swipe (right/left) in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.).

### ⭐ Other Interesting Projects

- **YourLinx** (Product): A local-only, private and personal golink Chrome Extension. Building with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **[Viralei](https://viralei.com.br)** (Hackathon): Turns legislative bills into engaging videos using AI. Built and deployed the MVP in 4 days, with Next.js. Still working on it.
- **[brave-byom-compat](https://github.com/marcelocra/brave-byom-compat)**: Compatibility layer between AI models and Brave's Leo AI.

### 🛠 Tech I Work With

I wrote my first line of code in 2010, in C. Then I learned Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. These days I work mostly with **TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS**, along with plenty of other tech when they are called for.

At Google I worked with **C++, Python, Java, and Bazel** (build systems). I also have experience with **VS Code Extensions API, Chrome Extensions API, Docker/Podman, and GitHub Actions**.

For AI work, I recently adopted **Roo Code** and it seems like it's going to be central to how I build: I'm using it for custom modes now and will try soon for spec-driven development. I also use **GitHub Copilot** (in VS Code and github.com), the **Codex extension**, **Jules** (jules.google.com), and **Kiro**. I've also used **Claude Code, Gemini CLI**, and **Zed** (zed.dev). I use **Anthropic API** and **OpenRouter** as model providers. Lots of prompt engineering.

### 💡 What I Learned & Believe

**From Google:**

- The value of **code reviews, testing, documentation**, and treating **maintainability as a feature**
- How to work with strict 6-week release cycles on a massive C++ codebase (Chromium)
- How to build globally scalable data pipelines (Java/Flume)
- That **good practices are fundamental** when creating great software

**What I believe now:**

- **Solid foundations matter**: Algorithms, system design, and architecture knowledge are essential to use AI tools effectively. **How will I know the AI gave me a good solution if I don't understand the bounds?**
- **AI as a teammate**: LLMs are powerful productivity multipliers, but human judgment on design and architecture is still essential.
- **Ship fast, maintain well**: High velocity with strong architectural oversight, not one or the other
- **Build in public**: I share my work openly, contributions welcome on all my repos. Developer tools improve fastest when shaped by the community using them.

**My path back to building:** After Google, I spent time in digital marketing, learning user psychology, sales copy, and how to take products to market. That experience sharpened how I think about user-facing products. Now I'm back to what I do best: building. AI gives me the leverage to ship like a team, without leaving the keyboard.
