  ## Hey there, welcome! 👋🏽

  **Ex-Google Engineer | Full-Stack Product Builder | AI-Augmented Developer**
</div>

My name is Marcelo. I'm a Computer Engineer from **ITA** and a former **Google** engineer with 15+ years of experience. I am now an entrepreneur building micro-SaaS, AI-native applications and developer tools.

I spent 4.5 years at Google[^google] before leaving to explore new ventures. Today, I work with an **"Engineer in the Loop"**[^eitl] approach: leveraging AI agents like **Cursor**, **Claude** and **Roo Code** as force multipliers. This allows me to ship high-quality code quickly while maintaining good architectural standards.

[^google]: Working mostly with C++, Python, and JavaScript on Chromium and Data Pipelines.
[^eitl]: "Engineer in the Loop" means using AI to accelerate implementation while the human engineer retains control over system design, architecture, and quality assurance.

### 🛠 Tech I Work With

I wrote my first line of code in 2010, in C. Then I learned Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. These days I work mostly with **TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS**, along with plenty of other tech when they are called for.

At Google I worked with **C++, Python, Java, and Bazel** (build systems). I also have experience with **VS Code Extensions API, Chrome Extensions API, Docker/Podman, and GitHub Actions**.

For AI work, I recently adopted **Roo Code** and it seems like it's going to be central to how I build: I'm using it for custom modes now and will try soon for spec-driven development. I also use **GitHub Copilot** (in VS Code and github.com), the **Codex extension**, **Jules** (jules.google.com), and **Kiro**. I've also used **Claude Code, Gemini CLI**, and **Zed** (zed.dev). I use **Anthropic API** and **OpenRouter** as model providers. Lots of prompt engineering.

### 💡 What I Learned & Believe

**From Google:**

- The value of **code reviews, testing, documentation**, and treating **maintainability as a feature**
- How to work with strict 6-week release cycles on a massive C++ codebase (Chromium)
- How to build globally scalable data pipelines (Java/Flume)
- That **good practices are fundamental** when creating great software

**What I believe now:**

- **Solid foundations matter**: Algorithms, system design, and architecture knowledge are essential to use AI tools effectively. **How will I know the AI gave me a good solution if I don't understand the bounds?**
- **AI as a teammate**: LLMs are powerful productivity multipliers, but human judgment on design and architecture is still essential.
- **Ship fast, maintain well**: High velocity with strong architectural oversight, not one or the other
- **Build in public**: I share my work openly, contributions welcome on all my repos. Developer tools improve fastest when shaped by the community using them.

**My path back to building:** After Google, I spent time in digital marketing, learning user psychology, sales copy, and how to take products to market. That experience sharpened how I think about user-facing products. Now I'm back to what I do best: building. AI gives me the leverage to ship like a team, without leaving the keyboard.
