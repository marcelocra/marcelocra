## Hello and Welcome! üëãüèΩ

My name is Marcelo, I'm a **Computer Engineer** from **ITA**, a Xoogler (ex-**Google**), a **full-stack programmer** with **16<!-- (curr_year - 2010 + 1) -->+ years** of experience, and an **entrepreneur**!

I worked **at Google for 4,5 years** and **quit to follow my entrepreneurship dreams**.

I wrote my **first line of code in 2010**, in C. Then I learned Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. Today I work mostly with JavaScript and TypeScript, Astro, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and F#. For the full list, including A LOT of stuff (even weird tech haha), read more.

I believe that **good practices** are fundamental when creating **great software**. I don't believe in **BDUF[^bduf]**, but I **know** from experience that **software design** is essential. I strongly believe that **maintainability** is an **extremelly important feature of a codebase**, perhaps the most important one (particularly for small companies).

If you want to know more, I have some links for you:

- <a href="https://bit.ly/40PVYPg" target="_blank">What I learned about software development so far, from best practices to technologies (including weird ones).</a>
- <a href="https://bit.ly/3QcYY3g" target="_blank">Learnings and some docs about specific tech (like Deno), written in Brazilian Portuguese - my blog!</a>

My social pages are linked in the profile, but the fastest way to reach me is by email (hello2 [at] marcelocra [dot] com).

Cheers!\
Marcelo.

<sub>P.S.: I added some typical GitHub readme stats, just because they are fun! üòÜÔ∏è</sub>\
<sub>P.S.2: My pinned repos show some of my projects. GitHub only allows 6, so I'll list more above, or at my website and CV.</sub>

[^bduf]: Big Design Up Front is a software development methodology in which the software design is fully completed before any coding happens. It is not applicable in many (most?) software development contexts, particularly apps and websites. Relates to the Waterfall model.

<summary>FYI: I'm ignoring some languages. Click here to see why.</summary>
<br />

1. They are not languages: HTML, CSS, Dockerfile, <sub>Vimscript and Shell (haha)</sub>.
1. I haven't used them meaningfully for a long time now: Python, Java, C, C++.
1. I use them mostly as "glue" and not to write real programs: Shell (mostly Bash), PowerShell, Vimscript.
