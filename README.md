### Hey, there, Marcelo here ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my coding home.

I'm working on a bunch of interesting stuff that will slowly appear here, so
follow if you'd like to know more.

Main topics:

- Dev workflow, setup and tools, with a focus on productivity
- Programming languages and projects interests:
  - Deno, Deno Fresh and Deno Deploy
  - Clojure and ClojureScript
  - F# (for web and apps, with Elmish and Bolero)

You can reach me easily on [Telegram](https://bit.ly/3NwNHXK) or on

Cheers! ;)
