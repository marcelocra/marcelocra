## Hey there, welcome! üëãüèΩ

My name is Marcelo. I‚Äôm a computer engineer from ITA, a former Google engineer, full-stack developer with 16<!-- (curr_year - 2010 + 1) -->+ years of experience, and an entrepreneur.

I spent 4.5 years at Google before quitting to explore something new.

I wrote my first line of code in 2010, in C. Then I learned Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. These days I work mostly with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and Tailwind CSS, along with plenty of other tech when they are called for.
