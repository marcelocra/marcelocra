## The most important things that I learned so far <a name="learnings"></a>

- Knowing technologies is **overrated**. With solid foundations we can learn and master most technologies.
- **BUT**... knowing technologies extremelly well is **underrated**. Being the go-to person about anything is really good both for us and our career
- **AND**... **some technologies are really bad**, particularly regarding developer experience (DX). DX is really helpful in keeping us and our peers highly productive.
- When solving a problem, choosing the appropriate architecture and doing some code design before actually coding help a lot in creating more maintainable software.
- Usually, it is better to start with the problem and choose the technology based on its requirements. Otherwise we might end up bing the person with the hammer in that saying: "for someone that only has a hammer, everything looks like a nail". Sometimes the best tool for the job is not the one we want to use. (This does not apply for when we are learning something, of course.)
- **Bad communication** is the root of a HUGE number of problems. Really. Basics:
  1. Just because we sent a message or an email, doesn't mean they received/read it. We can use a simple chat message to double check.
  1. Sending stuff to groups doesn't mean that every stakeholder will see/read it. Check with them too.
  1. Overcommunicating will almost ALWAYS be better than undercommunicating.
- People **underestimate (a lot!) the power of good documentation**. It can save hours of meetings and avoid having people as "single points of failure". And it also helps with the bad communication problem: we can always refer to the same doc that was reviewed instead of having to write the same messages or have the same meetings over and over again. Basically, documentation can help us use DRY ("don't repeat yourself", a software development principle) in communications.
- Automated testing is a MUST HAVE for any non-trivial projects.
- Good UX is essential if you are serious about your project.

## Will I be replaced by AI? <a name="solid-foundations"></a>

_[<small>(Back to the top)</small>](#me)_

I have no idea! But I don't think so!

I've been using both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to help me be more productive and think they are great at that!

I do believe that one needs solid foundations in order to employ these tools effectively. For example, how will I know that the AI gave me a good algorithmic solution for a problem if I don't understand what the bound are?

Here is a list of stuff that I consider very important:

- algorithms and data structures
- software design and architecture
- programming logic
- testing
- documentation
- code review
- great communication
- great UI and UX

## Technologies and languages I use or used <a name="tech"></a>

I made one just yesterday, before playing with Zig, and didn't think would make
another one today, but seems like only a couple of lines of Zig were enough to
put it above Go, so here we are. I guess this is because I'm excluding a number
of other "languages" I used, like Bash, PowerShell, etc.

Clojure's and JavaScripts' percentage increase doesn't make sense. I haven't
been writing thoses in my repos for a while now... actually, I've been writing
JavaScript, but not Clojure... what gives?

As I work through different language tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.org),
this graph will change more.
