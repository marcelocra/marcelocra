## The most important things that everyone should know <a name="should-know"></a>

-   Knowing technologies is **overrated**. With solid foundations you can learn
    and master most technologies.
-   But... knowing technologies extremelly well is **underrated**. Being the
    go-to person about anything is really good both for your career and yourself
    (mentally).
-   And... **some technologies are really bad**, particularly regarding
    developer experience (DX). DX is one of the most important things to keep
    you and other engineering people highly productive.
-   Thinking about a problem and its solution (architecture, design, etc) before
    actually coding goes a long way towards maintainability. _(That's why I
    mention in the initial page that I think before I code. You should do it
    too.)_
-   Start with the problem, not the technology that you want to use. Unless, of
    course, it is a toy project that you are using to learn something.
-   Bad communication is the root of a huge number of problems. Really. Some
    very basic stuff is:
    1. Just because you sent a message or an email it doesn't mean that the
       other person received it. Trust, but verify.
    1. Sending a document to people in a Slack channel or email doesn't mean
       that the stakeholders read it. Check with them and make sure that
       everyone is in the same page.
    1. Overcommunicating with ALWAYS be better than undercommunicating.
-   People underestimate (a lot!) the power of good documentation. It can save
    lots of hours of meetings. And it also helps with the bad communication
    problem: you can ping people pointing to a doc written that was once and
    agreed upon instead of having to write the same message over and over again
    (or even worse, have the same meeting over and over).
-   Automated testing is a MUST HAVE for any non-trivial projects.
-   Good UX is essential if you are serious about you project.

## Do you have solid foundations? <a name="solid-foundations"></a>

Essentially, to consider that you have it, you should have above average (at
least) knowledge of the following topics:

-   algorithms and data structures
-   software design and architecture
-   programming logic
-   testing
-   documentation
-   code review
-   communication
-   UX

## What technologies/languages have I worked with? <a name="tech"></a>

The ones that I used the most are:

-   JavaScript (React, Node.js)
-   Python
-   C++ ([please no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
-   Protocol Buffers
-   HTML/CSS
-   TypeScript
-   Vim
-   VSCode
-   Bazel (build system)
-   Bash ([noooooooo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
-   Java (also no)
-   REST (for APIs and databases - think crud)
-   SQL/NoSQL

But I used a LOT of others. I'll separate them into three groups.

There are more, but I won't remember all of them now.
