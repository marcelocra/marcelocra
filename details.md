## The most important things that everyone should know <a name="should-know"></a>

-   Knowing technologies is **overrated**. With solid foundations you can learn
    and master most technologies.
-   **BUT**... knowing technologies extremelly well is **underrated**. Being the
    go-to person about anything is really good both for your career and yourself
    (mentally).
-   **AND**... **some technologies are really bad**, particularly regarding
    developer experience (DX). DX is one of the most important things to keep
    you and other developers highly productive.
-   Thinking about a problem and its solution (architecture, design, etc) before
    actually coding goes a long way towards maintainability.
-   Start with the problem, not the technology that you want to use. Unless, of
    course, it is a toy project that you are using to learn something new.
-   **Bad communication** is the root of a HUGE number of problems. Really. Some
    very basic stuff is:
    1. Just because you sent a message or an email it doesn't mean that the
       other person received it. Trust, but verify.
    1. Sending a document to people in a Slack channel or email doesn't mean
       that every stakeholder will read it. Check with them and make sure that
       everyone is in sync.
    1. Overcommunicating will almost ALWAYS be better than undercommunicating.
-   People **underestimate (a lot!) the power of good documentation**. It can save
    hours of meetings and avoid having people as "single points of failure".
    And it also helps with the bad communication problem: you can always refer
    to the same doc that was written once and agreed upon, instead of having to
    write the same messages or have the same meeting over and over. Basically,
    DRY.
-   Automated testing is a MUST HAVE for any non-trivial projects.
-   Good UX is essential if you are serious about your project.

## Solid foundations are extremely important in the new AI phase of software development <a name="solid-foundations"></a>

_[<small>(Back to the top)</small>](#me)_

With the rapid development of new (and great!) AI coding "assistants", like
GitHub Copilot, having solid foundations is what will give you an edge. You
should know well the following topics:

-   algorithms and data structures
-   software design and architecture
-   programming logic
-   testing
-   documentation
-   code review
-   communication
-   UX

## What technologies/languages have I worked with? <a name="tech"></a>

_[<small>(Back to the top)</small>](#me)_

The ones that I used the most are:

-   JavaScript (React, Node.js)
-   Python
-   C++ ([but won't do it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
-   Protocol Buffers
-   HTML/CSS
-   TypeScript
-   Vim
-   VSCode
-   Bazel (build system)
-   Bash ([only when unavoidable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc))
-   Java (not really into this, specially with Kotlin and friends around)
-   REST (for APIs and databases - think CRUD)
-   SQL/NoSQL

But I used a LOT of others that I won't remember now.

I'll separate them into three groups:

### Used in at least one project <a name="project"></a>

-   Tachyons CSS
-   Bulma CSS
-   jQuery
-   Objective-C

Clojure's and JavaScripts' percentage increase doesn't make sense. I haven't
been writing thoses in my repos for a while now... actually, I've been writing
JavaScript, but not Clojure... what gives?

As I work through different language tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.org),
this graph will change more.
