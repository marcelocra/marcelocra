## Summary

Ex-Googler and ITA engineer with 15+ years of experience. I bridge the gap between complex system design, polished UI/UX, and high-velocity product shipping through an "**Engineer in the Loop**" workflow. By orchestrating AI agents and LLMs as a force multiplier, I deliver Google-standard code quality at the speed of an agile solo founder. Specialist in building user-centric developer tools, micro-SaaS, and AI-native applications that prioritize user psychology, visual polish, and architectural longevity.

- **Engineering**: System Design & Architecture, Data Pipelines, AI Agent Orchestration, Job Queues.
- **Product & Design**: Design Engineering (UI/UX Polish), User Psychology, Chrome/VS Code Extensions, Landing Page Optimization.
- **Technologies**: TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Vercel.
