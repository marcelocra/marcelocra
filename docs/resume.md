## Summary

Ex-Google Engineer (Data Pipelines/Chromium) and ITA[^ita] graduate with 15+ years of experience. I quit Big Tech to build AI-native tools and micro-SaaS products. Currently operating as an **"Engineer in the Loop,"** leveraging AI agents to ship high-quality code rapidly while maintaining architectural oversight.

[^ita]: Widely regarded as one of Brazil's top, if not the best, engineering institutes (Top 1%), known for its extremely rigorous entry and high academic standards.

## Professional Experience

### **Futurin** | Founder & Product Engineer
*Remote | 2023 — Present*

Founded a technical R&D lab to build developer tools and AI-native applications.

* **GhostKeys (Rust + AI):** Built a working Windows tray application in ~2 days with **zero prior Rust experience**. Used a spec-driven AI workflow (Kiro) to prove that strong system design skills can be ported to strict languages via agents.
* **Concept Compass & Infrastructure:** Built an infinite mind-map generator powered by OpenAI's OSS models. Initially attempted to host the LLMs locally but hit hardware constraints even with the smaller 20b model. This forced a transition to **OpenRouter**, which now powers most of my daily toolchain (Zed, Roo Code, Continue).
* **Solo Founder AI Engine:** Developed a 3-Phase Workflow for AI assisted development, optimizing costs and accuracy by leveraging different LLM models.
* **High-Velocity Shipping:** Placed **Top 3** in Brazil's largest AI Hackathon (Adapta). Built an OOH analytics MVP in ~24 hours using Next.js and AI APIs.

### **Vender Bem Online** | Founder & Digital Marketer
*Remote | 2020 — Present*

Digital marketing agency focused on paid media and product launches (PLF).

* **Execution & Copy**: Executed strategy and copy for product launches using the PLF method, learning sales psychology and user acquisition dynamics essential for building user-facing products.
* **Strategy & Data**: Driven user acquisition via data-backed paid media strategies, bridging the gap between technical features and market positioning—a critical asset for early-stage engineering.


### **Hubla** | Software Engineer
*Remote | May 2022 — May 2023*

* **System Design:** Structured the engineering team's design process, introducing mandatory RFCs which improved codebase quality and consistency.
* **Core Features:** Implemented frontend for order bumps, upsells, and mobile checkout.
* **Observability:** Designed and implemented logging infrastructure using OpenTelemetry specs.

### **Google** | Software Engineer
*Belo Horizonte, Brazil | Feb 2016 — Jan 2020*

* **Chromium:** Worked on the C++ codebase with strict 6-week release cycles. Refactored legacy components to add new features while also decoupling existing architecture and improving maintainability.
* **Data Pipelines:** Designed and built globally scalable data processing pipelines using Dataflow (Java).
* **Cross-Functional:** Acted as the technical bridge between PMs and Design to ensure feasibility of features.

## Skills & Stack

* **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust (AI-Assisted), C++, Java.
* **Web Stack:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Supabase.
* **AI Workflow:** Zed, Cursor, OpenCode/Aider, VS Code (with Roo Code & Continue.dev), Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and Google Jules.
* **Tooling:** OpenRouter, Anthropic API, Google AI Studio, Firebase Studio, Chrome Extensions API, Docker/Podman, DevContainers.

## Education

### **ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica)**
**B.S. Computer Engineering**
*São José dos Campos, Brazil | Jan 2010 — Dec 2015*

Widely regarded as one of Brazil's top, if not the best, engineering institutes (Top 1%), known for its extremely rigorous entry and high academic standards.

**Exchange year at University of Twente and TU/e (Netherlands)**
