title: Content Licensing: TL;DR and Deep Dive

## TL;DR

- Code uses `Apache-2.0` (see `LICENSE`). You can use, modify, and share code with attribution; it's provided as-is.
- Content (text & images I created) uses `CC BY-NC 4.0` (see `LICENSE-CONTENT`). You can reuse/remix with credit, but not for commercial use.
- Third-party assets (logos, screenshots, trademarks) are owned by their respective owners and are not covered by these licenses.

## Deep Dive

### What's a License?

A license is a permission slip that says what other people can do with your work. Different licenses fit different kinds of work: code vs. content.

### Code vs. Content

- Code licenses (like `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`) are built for software: reuse, modification, distribution, patent grants, and liability disclaimers.
- Content licenses (like `Creative Commons`) are built for text, images, docs, and media: attribution, commercial-vs-noncommercial, and share-alike rules.

### Why Two Licenses?

- Code and content have different needs. Apache-2.0 is great for code because it includes a patent grant and clear reuse terms. Creative Commons is better for words and pictures because it focuses on attribution and reuse patterns familiar to content.

### Apache-2.0 for Code

- Permissions: Use, modify, distribute, and sublicense.
- Requirements: Keep attribution and license notices, mark changes.
- Patents: Includes a patent grant from contributors; litigating patents can terminate your rights.
- Warranty: Provided "as-is" with limitation of liability.

### CC BY-NC 4.0 for Content

- Permissions: Copy, redistribute, remix, transform, and build upon the material.
- Requirements: Give appropriate credit (to "Marcelo Almeida (@marcelocra)"), link the license, and indicate changes.
- NonCommercial: Cannot be used for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
- Flexibility: You can still grant separate permissions to someone if you want.

### What Counts as "Commercial"?

- Direct sale of the content, using it in paid products, paid courses, or monetized campaigns generally counts as commercial.
- Noncommercial examples: personal blogs, school projects, community wikis, or non-monetized posts.

### How to Attribute Correctly

Include: creator's name, license name, license link, and change note.
Example: "Content Copyright 2025 Marcelo Almeida (@marcelocra), licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/; changes made."

### Third-Party Assets

- Logos, trademarks, and screenshots belong to their owners.
- They're often allowed in commentary and documentation under fair use or specific terms, but they're not covered by this repo's licenses.

### Practical Repo Setup

- `LICENSE`: Apache-2.0 for code.
- `LICENSE-CONTENT`: CC BY-NC 4.0 for non-code content.
- README note: Clarify both, and mention third-party asset handling.

### Can I Change or Dual-License Later?

Yes. You own your work and can grant additional permissions (e.g., commercial-use exceptions) separately. Prior recipients keep the rights they received under the published license.

### Questions?

If you're unsure whether your use is commercial or how to attribute, open an issue describing your use-case.
