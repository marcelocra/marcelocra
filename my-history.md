# My story

- I completed my **Computer Engineering** undergrad at **ITA**, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, one of the most renowned engineering schools in Brazil 🇧🇷, from 2010 to 2015.
- I did a one year exchange program in The Netherlands 🇳🇱 in 2013, attending both the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), and the University of Twente (UT).
- I worked at **Google** as an intern for 6 months in 2015 and as a **full-time engineer** from **2016 to 2020**.
  - As an **intern**, I worked mostly in an iOS app, rewriting its automated testing infrastructure. I wrote a lot of Objective-C and some Python. I used [Bazel](https://bazel.build) and Earl Grey (testing framework).
  - As a **full-time engineer**, I wrote C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and some Shell (more than I wanted).
- I worked at two startups after 2020, until **deciding to create my own company**.
  - Wrote mostly JavaScript and TypeScript, for React and Node.

## At Google

Google is an amazing place to work and I recommend it very much for anyone who wants to be in a place that values software developement.

They take best practices really seriously: it is strongly embedded in the culture and daily engineering practices, and includes code reviews, testing, documentation, etc., always with a strong focus on code quality, readability, and maintainability.

I learned a lot, practicing software development at a very high level, with great and smart people, in a great environment.

But I wanted to create my own company.

## After quitting

At first, I worked in a startup as a Product Manager who coded. I wanted to learn more about the business side of things and interacted daily with the startup CEO.

Then, I worked with digital marketing and online ads, to learn the best ways of taking a product to the market and to as many people as possible.

Eventually, I get the rare opportunity to work as a Developer in a digital marketing startup, where I could combine my coding skills with my marketing knowledge. I helped them model their new system (and database structure) with knowledge that no other engineer had.

Finally, I decided to create my own company, where I could use all my knowledge and experience to create products that I couldn't find in the market.
