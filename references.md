# References - Useful, interesting and cool coding stuff

## Technologies

- [Astro](https://astro.build): it is a full-stack web framework that defaults to generating VERY fast static sites, with great Lighthoust/Speedtest results. I created my website using it (the **site** repo pinned below).

  Good performance means better user experinece, and it should always be one of our focuses.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): a great alternative to writing pure CSS. It is easy to learn, use, has great developer experience, and help us produce beautiful websites, quickly.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/): Tailwind plugin with beautiful styles for frequently used components (button, tooltip, etc).
- [Deno](https://deno.land): JavaScript and TypeScript runtime with very interesting features, e.g. a fine-grained permission system, npm support, no `node_modules`, etc. Can be used as a replacement for Node in many cases. Pair well with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org): amazing language for people that are not allergic to parethesis hahaha.
- [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka): an alternative Clojure installation/runtime for running Clojure code without the JVM startup penalty.
- [nbb](https://github.com/babashka/nbb): Babashka for Node. An alternative ClojureScript installation/runtime for running ClojureScript code without a compilation step.
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx): great helper for writing conditional CSS/Tailwind classes.

## Code references

- [Google Closure Keyboard Shortcut Handler example](https://gist.github.com/marcelocra/930fc699e3b6367df1aad81811668e3c): an example of how to create a simple Keyboard handler. Works in JavaScript too, even though the example is in ClojureScript.
- [ClojureScript nbb example script](https://gist.github.com/marcelocra/0f41381c0c1e251efe700a1c3bb0e3fa): an example nbb script from the creator or nbb. (The link is to my fork of it.)

## Tech interview references

(Disclaimer: I haven't used all references mentioned here. In each section I mention which ones I actually used.)

- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com.br/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850): great book that helped me pass Google interviews. It was the 4th edition back then, I think, and I completed most of it, especially the exercises.

- [Tech interview cheat sheet](https://github.com/tsiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet)

  > _This list is meant to be both a quick guide and reference for further research into these topics. It's basically a summary of that comp sci course you never took or forgot about, so there's no way it can cover everything in depth._
